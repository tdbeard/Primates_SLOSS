This GitHub repository contains the data and script for the manuscript "Small patches have high conservation value for primates".

The raw data used in this research is an "in preparation" database of primate patch occupancy, created by searching primary and gray literature from 1995-2020 for articles that reported primate species with spatial occurrence and geographic coordinate data, anywhere in the world.

***********************************
PLEASE NOTE - the original data in this repository contained variables of interest (e.g. functional traits and sampling measures) which were not used in this study. However, this additional information was not yet standardised or validated. 
This will be done at a future date and released as an official database. 
If you made use of the original data, PLEASE VALIDATE THE DATA WITH THE SOURCE LITERATURE!

Explanation of scripts are below. Data has been provided (in data folder) so certain steps of this coding process can be skipped, rather than having to run through all scripts. Please see README_data.txt file in data folder for more information on the data.


Scripts:

00_InitialDatabase.R - initial collation into one data frame and initial cleaning of the "in preparation" database of primate patch occupancy.

01_ForestRasterGeneration.R - generation of bespoke forest rasters (forest = 1, non-forest = 0) of Hansen et 2013 Global Forest Change maps for each dataset (occupancy data for a particular species from a particular study) that encompass the spatial extent of the dataset.

02_PatchGeneration.R - generation of patch sizes (in hectares) associated with the XY points of occupancy

03_1_PatchCombinationsFunctions.R - bespoke functions that are used in 03_2_PatchCombinationsGeneration.R

03_2_PatchCombinationsGeneration.R - generation of patch combinations i.e. combinations of one or more patches totalling a predefined threshold of cumulative habitat amount. 

04_BrmModel.R - Bayesian model for Mean Patch Size method of analysing occupancy as a function of mean patch size. Lower mean patch size = several small patches and higher mean patch size = few large patches

05_1_Figures_Methods.R - Code for producing elements of Figures 1 - 3, those figures representing the Methods used. These elements are combined outside a coding environment to produce finalised figures.

05_2_Figures_Results.R - Code for producing Figures 4 - 6. 
	i) Figure 4 - produces histograms of distribution of a) patches and b) patch combinations with presence and absence proportions
	ii) Figure 5 - uses output from posterior distribution of Bayesian model to produce a) parameter estimates b) global plot of log odds of occupancy as a function of mean patch size and c) per IUCN category plot of log odds of occupancy as a function of mean patch size
	iii) Figure 6 - derives pairs of SL and SS patch combinations (using SL ≤ 3 patches and SS ≥ 4 patches), directly compares occupancy between these pairs, and then produces bar plots of a) global and b) per IUCN category of the three different outcomes and their overall proportions: SL > SS, SL = SS and SS > SL.

06_Figures_SM.R - Code for producing all supplementary figures.
